                    <p>Tomee is a very small but TCK compliant JavaEE server. I
                        wanted to play with it for quite some time. At the same time a
                        hardfloat JVM was released as release candidate for the RaspBerry
                        PI.</p>

                    <p>We love to watch movies here. In fact we see so much movies
                        that sometimes we kinda forget which ones we have seen. So I
                        combined my wanting to do something with Tomee, RaspBerry PI and
                        the movie watching.
