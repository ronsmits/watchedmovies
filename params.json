{"body":"### Watched movies.\r\nwhy?\r\n\r\nTomee is a very small but TCK compliant JavaEE server. I wanted to play with it for quite some time. At the same time a hardfloat JVM was released as release candidate for the RaspBerry PI.\r\n\r\nWe love to watch movies here. In fact we see so much movies that sometimes we kinda forget which ones we have seen. So I combined my wanting to do something with Tomee, RaspBerry PI and the movie watching.\r\n\r\nAll the source code can be found at here at git hub\r\n\r\nIssues, feature requests and the likes might, or might not get picked up. You can always Fork the code. If you do and you do something you would like to see added to the main branch just send a pull request.\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n","name":"Watchedmovies","tagline":"A very very simple excercise with Tomee, Rest and Jade","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
